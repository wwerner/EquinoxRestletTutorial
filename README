This repository contains the code for the restlet/equinox tutorial on http://blog.wolfgang-werner.net/

Abstract:
In this series, we'll look at creating modular server applications based on OSGi/Equinox and Restlet. 
The first article of this series covers the basics: It will walk you through creating a Restlet based web application 
and show you how to wrap it into a standalone application based on the equinox OSGi framework.

The next posts will go into how the different Restlet types can be assembled into bigger applications. 
We'll then build extension points to lift the actual plumbing to a declarative level instead of hardcoding it.
We'll see that the uniform interface described in REST and the extension/extension point mechanisms make quite a good couple.
